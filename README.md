# 🐾 Animal Segmentation Project  

## 🔍 **Overview**  
This project was inspired by the **AI Academy Hackathon: "In the Footsteps of Animals"**, where the challenge was to develop a robust deep learning model for **animal segmentation**. The goal was to create an algorithm capable of accurately distinguishing animals from their surroundings in images, which is crucial for applications in wildlife monitoring, conservation, and autonomous systems.  

## 🚀 **Our Approach**  

### 📌 **1. Baseline Exploration**  
We began by studying the **baseline model** provided by the hackathon organizers. This initial solution served as a starting point, allowing us to understand the dataset, preprocessing steps, and the general performance of segmentation models. While the baseline provided decent results, we saw potential for improvement and began experimenting with alternative architectures.  

### 🎯 **2. Model Selection & Optimization**  
To enhance accuracy, we researched various deep learning models, adjusting hyperparameters and training strategies. After extensive testing, we identified a more powerful model that significantly outperformed the baseline in terms of **precision, recall, and segmentation quality**.  

### 🔄 **3. Blending for the Best Performance**  
Our final submission utilized a **blending technique**, combining the strengths of two models:  
- **A model trained for a high number of epochs**, which captured complex patterns and refined features.  
- **A model trained for fewer epochs**, which prevented overfitting and maintained generalization across diverse images.  
- We **averaged the predictions** of both models, creating a more stable and accurate segmentation output.  

## 📊 **Results & Impact**  
This blended approach significantly improved segmentation accuracy, making the model more adaptable to different lighting conditions, backgrounds, and animal species. By leveraging multiple training strategies, we achieved a well-balanced solution that performed reliably across test images.  

## 🏆 **Conclusion**  
Through careful model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and blending strategies, we developed a **robust and efficient animal segmentation model**. This project not only improved our understanding of computer vision techniques but also demonstrated the power of model ensemble methods in achieving superior results.
